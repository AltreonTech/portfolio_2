# FitFlex — Smart Gym Membership & Engagement Platform

FitFlex is a fully responsive gym website solution designed for fitness centers that want to digitalize their membership process and improve customer engagement.  
The platform allows visitors to explore training programs, check membership pricing (monthly/quarterly/half-yearly/yearly), submit inquiry forms, and complete online payments securely for immediate enrollment.

## How the System Works

### 📌 Step-by-Step Flow
1. **User visits the homepage**, where they see hero banners, gym highlights, trainer expertise, transformation images & testimonials.
2. **User explores membership plans** — 1 Month, 3 Months, 6 Months, and 12 Months, each showing included benefits.
3. If interested, they can:
   - **Send a query using Contact Form**
   - **Proceed to Online Payment** to instantly purchase a subscription.
4. **Payment gateway (Stripe/Razorpay)** handles secure transactions.
5. After payment:
   - User receives **email confirmation**
   - Admin receives new member details via dashboard
6. Admin can track queries, plan purchases, & manage member details.
