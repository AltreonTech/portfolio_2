## 🔍 How the System Works (Detailed Flow)

### **1. Customer Flow**
- The user visits the website and sees available **services** (haircut, consultation, therapy, etc.).
- They select:
  - A service  
  - A staff member (optional)  
  - A preferred date  
  - A time slot based on real-time availability  
- They enter basic details (name, phone, email).
- The booking is instantly confirmed, and:
  - A **confirmation email/SMS** is sent  
  - The appointment appears in the **admin dashboard**

### **2. Admin Flow**
The business owner logs in to access:

- **Dashboard:** Total bookings, upcoming appointments, open slots

- **Service Management:** Add/update prices, duration, categories  
- **Staff Management:** Assign service availability
